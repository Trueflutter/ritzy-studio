# 08 Chief Architect Handoff

## Current State

Ritzy Studio has completed the first fourteen MVP implementation slices.

The repository now contains:

- documentation control layer
- pnpm workspace
- Next.js TypeScript app in `apps/web`
- `packages/config` environment validation
- Supabase auth, schema, RLS, and storage foundation
- protected project, room, photo upload, and brief flows
- `packages/prompts` and `packages/ai`
- versioned OpenAI clarifying-question generation
- initial OpenAI `gpt-image-2` concept generation
- concept critique, selection, and revision generation
- catalog ingestion package, adapter contract, normalization, and ingestion run helper
- retailer adapters: Home Centre UAE, 2XL Home, and Chattels & More
- product enrichment prompt, text embedding helper, and enrichment provenance schema
- selected-concept product grounding with draft shopping list candidates
- line-level product substitution for draft shopping list items

The locked design system exists at:

`docs/Vision/05_Brand_and_Design_System.md`

The MVP documentation control layer has been created under:

`docs/Tracks/mvp/`

## Source Of Truth Order

Use this order:

1. `docs/Tracks/mvp/02_Feature_List.json`
2. `docs/Tracks/mvp/process/progress.md`
3. `docs/Tracks/mvp/08_Chief_Architect_Handoff.md`
4. supporting track docs
5. actual codebase

For visual implementation, `docs/Vision/05_Brand_and_Design_System.md` is locked and canonical.

## Current Canonical Slice

`F-015 Final Grounded Render Generation`

Status: not started.

Expected boundaries:

- `apps/web`
- `apps/web`
- `packages/prompts`
- `packages/ai`
- `packages/db`
- `packages/ui`

## Locked Product Workflow

1. Designer uploads room photos and writes a brief.
2. System generates initial concept directions first.
3. Designer critiques and refines concepts.
4. After concept approval, system searches automated retailer catalog data.
5. Designer reviews and substitutes real products.
6. System generates final grounded render.
7. Shopping list is produced from selected product records.

## Key Constraints

- Do not introduce a designer-facing CSV product upload workflow.
- Do not treat generated images as product truth.
- Do not imply exact SKU rendering.
- Do not certify product fit from photo-only dimensions.
- Do not drift from the locked design system.

## Suggested Next Action

Begin F-015:

- generate final grounded renders from selected concept, original room photo, and selected shopping list products
- pass selected product images as references where supported
- store render job product and prompt provenance
- make SKU-exactness limits visible in UI
- implement failure/retry behavior

## Open Questions

- Confirm the hosted Supabase migration path before deploying beyond local development.
- Confirm export format before F-017.
